# hackathon-with-MiSaTo
various scripts for the MiSaTo dataset (made by me during the event, might be messy) and notes/draft plots for hackathon.bio

## Dataset

https://github.com/sab148/MiSaTo-dataset

## Repo structure

- `preprocessing_scripts`: scripts and jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing. Description and the order in which they were run is described inside the folder's README.

- `exploratorial` - notebooks with plots computed from preprocessed data.

- `models` - code for models to be run on precomputed data (mostly colab notebooks are used at the moment)

The link to preprocessed data might also be published, but I plan to focus on creation of scripts which can be rerun to reproduce the results, than on storing the data (might publish them on Kaggle or Huggingface though).
